#	RV Automation

##	Goal

This project should control the LED's under the camper (2 strips 32 feet on each side), the LED's under the awning (Single 16 ft strip), control the slides and awning, detect wind speed to retract and extend the awning automatically, and control lighting.

It will all be controlled via BLE from a phone app.

Phone will be the server and the devices will be clients. There will be multiple EPS32's in this config.

One for the interior control and one for exterior and if so, I may utilize a 3rd esp as a bridge.
